🚀 Major Feature Expansion – Botnet Billionaire
🧠 Prestige-Exclusive Meta Gameplay
Create Your Own Malware – During each prestige run, synthesize custom malware combinations by selecting Attack Vector + Payload + Delivery Method to create thousands of unique builds that give specific gameplay bonuses.

Build Digital HQ – Spend special resources to build and upgrade a hideout base (modules like server racks, firewalls, VPN hubs, encryption cores) to permanently boost production and defense capabilities.

🌍 World Domination Layer
Interactive World Map Takeover – Expand your influence country by country on a real-world map; each location conquered grants different passive perks and hacking advantages.

Faction System – Join hacker factions such as Anonymous, Shadow Syndicate, or Neo-Phreaks. Each faction offers exclusive upgrades, perks, and cosmetic identity themes.

🔬 Research & Adversaries
Research Tech Tree – A long-term branching technology system where you invest packets into unlocking new botnet types, malware traits, packet compression, stealth tools, and economic bonuses.

Rival Hackers (AI Enemies) – Competing AI hacker groups periodically attack you, attempting to steal packets or interrupt production. Deploy defenses or launch counter-hacks to retaliate.

Mini-Events (RNG Pop-ups) – Random timed events (e.g., “Exposed Government Terminal!”) give the player a chance to click for huge bursts of packets, unique exploits, or temporary buffs.

Offline Earnings – Continue farming packets while the player is offline. On login show a terminal popup: “While you were gone, your botnet harvested X packets.”

💣 NEW: Cyber Raid System
Hack major global corporations (e.g., “MegaBank”, “DataForge”, “TelTech Industries”) during Cyber Raids to steal massive packets and rare upgrade items.

Each raid launches a short hacker-style puzzle or minigame (e.g., circuit tracing, password cracking, packet-routing, intercept timing challenges).

Every corporation has a cooldown timer before you can raid them again.

As you raid them repeatedly, they upgrade their cybersecurity, making puzzles progressively harder and introducing new mechanics and countermeasures.

Successful raids can also weaken rival factions and unlock world-event scale upgrades.
